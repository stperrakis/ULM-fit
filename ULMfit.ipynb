        "> Nowadays, Neural Networks are a hot field of Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, many services deploy neural networks to solve regression and classification problems. In classification problems, there are some observations and the object is to classify them into possible classes. The training of models from scratch is time-consuming and requires a lot of data.\n",
        "To decrease the needed data and possibly the training time, learning techniques are developed, such as transfer learning et. al... The ULMfit[[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) is an inductive transfer learning method developed by Jeremy Howard, Sebastian Ruder. This project aims to build a classification algorithm by using pre-trained models which will be trained by the ULMfit transfer learning method. \n"

Training the language model has been done by running the text corpus through a bidirectional language model with an embedding size of 400, **3 layers** and 1150 hidden activations per layer.

However, these weights only penetrate through the surface of the neural network. In practice, neural networks usually contain more than one layer, so the information has to be transferred to other layers to do accurate predictions.\n",

The slanted triangular learning rates method is firstly linearly increase the learning rate and then linearly decays it. \n",

We then unfreeze the next lower frozen layer and repeat, until we finetune all layers until convergence at the last iteration."
