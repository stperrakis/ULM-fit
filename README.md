# ULMfit: Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning for Text Classification

This repository contains an implementation of the ULMfit (Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning) approach. ULMfit is a powerful transfer learning method for natural language processing tasks, designed to enable efficient fine-tuning of language models for text classification or similar tasks.

## Overview

The notebook provides:
- **A detailed introduction to transfer learning in NLP.**
- **Step-by-step instructions to fine-tune a pretrained language model.**
- **Methods for evaluating and visualizing model performance.**

## Features

- **Language Model Pretraining:** Leverage a pretrained language model to reduce training time and data requirements.
- **Fine-tuning:** Adapt the model to your specific dataset.
- **Classification:** Train a classifier on top of the fine-tuned language model for downstream tasks.
